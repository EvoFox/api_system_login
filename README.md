# REST API Coding Practice 1: 
## Microservices architecture, Overall Login
I began this project to learn how best to develop a decoupled application in JavaScript, I plan on having three distinct applications that can all be run from the front end, controlled by a login page that will issue permissions to access individual applications.

The repository you are currently looking at is going to handle the initial logging into the site, and handing out the permissions to access the distinct applications.

### Installation
After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install the following dependancies:
```
    ExpressJS
    Mongoose
    JsonWebToken
    DotEnv
    CORS
    BcryptJS
    NodeMon
```
Then create a `.env` file, copying the information from `.env.template` and filling out the variables there.
